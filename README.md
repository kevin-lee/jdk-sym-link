# jdk-sym-link

JDK symbolic link creator for macOS.

## How to install

### Native App
It should work on both **Intel** and **M1** Mac.
```shell
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kevin-lee/jdk-sym-link/main/.scripts/install.sh)" 
```


### JVM App
If the native one doesn't work, try this JVM one.
**NOTE: It requires JVM**.

/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kevin-lee/jdk-sym-link/main/.scripts/install-jvm.sh)" 
```
